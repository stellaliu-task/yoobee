# RentFlex Maintenance Plan

This document outlines the core maintenance strategy for the RentFlex car rental system.

## Version Control

RentFlex follows Semantic Versioning (**X.Y.Z**):
- **X**: Major version - Incompatible API changes
- **Y**: Minor version - New features (backward-compatible)
- **Z**: Patch version - Bug fixes (backward-compatible)

### Branching Strategy

- **main**: Latest stable version
- **develop**: Next version development
- **feature/xxx**: New features
- **hotfix/xxx**: Emergency fixes

## Upgrade Strategy

### Database & Backend
- Use Alembic for database migrations
- Backup before upgrades
- Major versions may include API changes
- Minor versions maintain backward compatibility

### Frontend
- Maintain UI/UX consistency
- Update dependencies regularly
- Support modern browsers

## Backward Compatibility

- Database changes preserve existing data
- API versioning (e.g., /api/v1/, /api/v2/)
- Deprecated features have transition periods
- Frontend adapts to API versions

## Release Schedule

- **Major versions**: Every 6-12 months
- **Minor versions**: Every 1-3 months
- **Patches**: As needed
- **Security updates**: Immediate

## Testing Requirements

All releases must pass:
- Unit and integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Security scans

## Support Policy

- Latest major version: Full support
- Previous major version: Security updates only
- Older versions: No support

This plan will be reviewed periodically to align with project needs and best practices.
